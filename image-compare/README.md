# Getting started with Vev CLI

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create Vev App](https://github.com/vev-design/create-vev-app).


### Initialize 

In your project directory run:
```bash 
vev init
```

This will initialize a new components package in the Vev platform.

### Run

```
vev start
```
Now you can open the [Vev design editor](https://editor.vev.design/), your components will be available in all your projects as long as the CLI is running.

### Build 

Open `./src/MyComponent.tsx` and start building your  React components.

* [Register Vev component](https://developer.vev.design/docs/cli/react/register-vev-component)
* [Vev props](https://developer.vev.design/docs/cli/react/vev-props)
* [Vev components]([/docs/cli/react/components](https://developer.vev.design/docs/cli/react/components))
* [Vev hooks](https://developer.vev.design/docs/cli/react/hooks)
* [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

### Deploy 

Deploy your package:

```
vev deploy
```

You can choose to share your components with your account, workspace or team. Configuration is done in the [vev.json](https://developer.vev.design/docs/cli/configuration) file.
